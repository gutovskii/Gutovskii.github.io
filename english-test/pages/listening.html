				<strong>Question 1.</strong> â€“ So, do you have a favourite movie? â€“ Oh â€¦ thatâ€™s difficult. Well â€¦ I think it has to be The Agents, the Mel Rivers movie. I like it because it reminds you that no matter how hard life is, or how many times you get knocked down by bad situations, things can get a whole lot worse. â€“ When did you first see it? â€“ On television, late one nightâ€¦ I must have been about sixteen. There were moments when I just couldnâ€™t stop laughing. Itâ€™s anarchic and silly, but itâ€™s very warm. I love the friendship that develops between the two main characters.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 2.</strong> I think this is the last time Iâ€™m buying anything from that shop. I canâ€™t believe how inefficient they are! But theyâ€™ve got reasonable prices. The next time I buy a sofa, Iâ€™d be prepared to pay double to avoid all this stress. They came to deliver it, and when I saw it I thought, This isnâ€™t the sofa I chose, maybe the colour looks different in daylight. But it was mine And then I realised that part of the cover at the back was torn and the filling was coming out. So I got them to take it away and now I have to wait two weeks to get it replaced.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 3.</strong> Most actors start out with a bit of a regional or non-standard accent of some sort, but what tends to happen is that, at drama school, part of the training is to acquire whatâ€™s called â€˜standard Englishâ€™. So you lose your original accent and when somebody says, you know, â€˜Do something in your old voice,â€™ it takes a couple of minutes to click in and get your head round it again. I phone my parents and they say, â€˜My, you sound so English!â€™ but then over here I sometimes donâ€™t get work because people can hear that Iâ€™m actually Australian, so Iâ€™ve got a bit more work to do there.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 4.</strong> â€“ Can you still remember the thrill of it? I mean, the first time you actually ride out there, out in front must be â€¦ â€“ Yeah, yeah, it was certainly a big thrill, but it was an evening event. It was the last race and it was almost dark by the time weâ€™d finished and when I got home it was about ten or eleven oâ€™clock, so there was very little time to think about it or do anything. And I had to be up at about half five the next day for my job, so, unfortunately, it was straight back to work really.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 5.</strong> I was always fascinated by the musical theatre, from the very word go. My aunt was an actress, not a particularly successful one, but I thought her world was unbelievably glamorous. And she used to take me to London to see some of the American musicals which were on in Great Britain some time after they were on in New York, and so I got to see a lot of things at a very early age. It just grabbed me, it was one of those things.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 6.</strong> The earliest records of this trade go back to the Ancient Greek period, with various deals around the Mediterranean area. Unlike the trade in more decorative or luxury goods, however, few written records remain. So we mostly rely on archaeological evidence, which does show, for example, that designs for swords spread from Greece to the rest of Europe. And using the type of research more usually associated with the spread of artistic trends, we can now show how the equipment necessary to do battle was being exported.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 7.</strong> The best thing about the Eurostar train is that it is city centre to city centre. I almost always travel with colleagues and we use the train as a second office. Sometimes there are as many as nine of us and I schedule formal meetings to have on the train. I invite suppliers and clients who have meetings in Paris on the same day to travel with us so we can discuss business. Itâ€™s a perfect opportunity to talk without the distractions of the office â€“ we donâ€™t switch on our mobile phones.<br><br>

				<strong>Question 8.</strong> Itâ€™s no good just standing there saying youâ€™re sorry, because that isnâ€™t going to give me the photographs youâ€™ve lost, Is it? And I took them on a once-in-a- lifetime holiday, so itâ€™s impossible to replace them. It didnâ€™t cross my mind for an instant that you could lose a roll of film, just like that. To be frank, I think itâ€™s an insult just to offer me a new roll in its place. I would expect at the very least to be offered a refund, and compensation for the loss and inconvenience, even if it isnâ€™t your normal policy.<br><br>

				<strong>1.</strong> You hear someone on the radio reviewing a play. Red Roses is a new play about a young Russian girl living in London who wants to become an actress but has to work on a flower stall to make a living. The story is powerful and moving. The acting, in general, is good too, although I found some of the characters slightly unbelievable. I think this was a problem with the way their parts were written rather than the way the actors performed. Overall, I recommend going to see the play. It lasts approximately two hours and is on for the rest of this week.<br><br>

				<strong>2.</strong> You hear two friends talking about learning something new.
				Girl: Iâ€™d quite like to do something a bit unusual. Not a sport or a language, or anything like that- something a bit creative maybe, like a painting.
				Boy: I agree. I already do basketball but Iâ€™ve probably got time for another hobby too. The problem is, Iâ€™m really not very good at painting. Iâ€™m about as good at it as I am at dancing!
				Girl: In that case, an art class sounds just right for you. Youâ€™ll soon learn, and I really want to give it a try.
				Boy: Well, all right then. Itâ€™ll be fun if we do it together.<br><br>

				<strong>3.</strong> You hear a young woman talking on the radio. My mother is an actress and my father is a film director, so I suppose they had a big influence on my career ambitions when I was young. I joined a drama class and got a few parts in TV commercials, but I was more interested in the script and the way it was directed than in acting. Iâ€™ve always been a keen reader, so I suppose I naturally thought about being an author. I wrote my first short story when I was about 15, and after that nothing could stop me. I didnâ€™t do much acting after that.<br><br>

				<strong>4.</strong> You hear two friends talking.
				Teenage boy: I fancy something to eat. What about you?
				Teenage girl: Good idea. Shall we have something in the cafe? It looks really busy though. Or we could go outside- itâ€™s a lovely sunny day.
				Teenage boy: True, but will they let us back in again? I havenâ€™t seen everything I want to see yet.
				Teenage girl: Of course, they will. Weâ€™ve got tickets, havenâ€™t we? People spend all day in these places, they can come and go as they please.<br><br>

				<strong>5.</strong> You hear a musician talking about his band. Of course, we had talent. Take our lead guitarist, for example- I donâ€™t know anyone who can play like him. But talent isnâ€™t enough if nobody notices you. Everything changed after we got our new manager, Lucy. Lucy had friends in the music industry, like record producers, and people on TV. She got us auditions, concerts and a lot of media coverage too. Then it all happened really fast. We went from performing in restaurants and at weddings to making headlines. Without Lucy, we would be nothing.<br><br>

				<strong>6.</strong> You hear a boy and girl talking about their plans.
				Boy: Itâ€™s still raining. What do you want to do this afternoon?
				Girl: We could play computer games. Or how about going round to Meganâ€™s house?
				Boy: Meganâ€™s away this week. And I donâ€™t really want to stay at home just because itâ€™s raining.
				Girl: I know! Dad can take us into the Metrocentre.
				Boy: Cool! I need to buy some trainers, and there are some good shops there. Maybe thereâ€™s a film on at the cinema too.
				Girl: Thereâ€™s nothing good on this week, but Iâ€™m happy to go around town. I need to buy some things anyway.<br><br>

				<strong>7.</strong> You hear a tour guide talking to a group of tourists. Right, weâ€™re going to stop in a minute to look at the Hollywood Bowl, probably the most famous outdoor concert arena in the United States. Some of the greatest names in music have performed there, like The Beatles. Now, when we get off the coach, weâ€™ve got a group ticket, so you can just walk on through into the arena. Go right to the top for a great view of the famous Hollywood sign. After that, weâ€™re going to meet back here at the coach and drive to Griffith Park, where weâ€™ll go for a walk.<br><br>

				<strong>8.</strong> You hear a girl talking about singing in a competition. I was really nervous before the show. Iâ€™d been practising my song for ages. But practice isnâ€™t everything, is it? As I walked out onto the stage in front of hundreds of people, I felt terrified! I knew people at school were watching me on TV too, and that made me even more nervous. Would they laugh at me the next day at school? My parents were in the audience though, so I tried to think about them instead. I couldnâ€™t see them because of all the lights, but I knew they were there. That helped me a lot.<br><br>
