				<h3>The World of Parkour</h3><br>

				In 1902, a volcano in the Caribbean island of Martinique blew up. A French naval officer on the scene, Lt. George HÃ©bert managed to coordinate the rescue of over 700 people, both indigenous and European. He noticed, as he did so, how people moved, some well, some badly, around the obstacles in their path, and how this affected their chances of survival. HÃ©bert had travelled widely and was well aware of skills many indigenous people exhibited in being able to traverse the natural environment. From these experiences, HÃ©bert developed a training discipline which he called â€˜the natural methodâ€™ in which climbing, jumping and running techniques were used to negotiate obstacles. His method was adopted by the French military and became the basis for all their training. In time, it became known as <i>parcours du combattant</i> â€“ the path of the warrior.<br><br>

				Raymond Belle was a practitioner of parcour in Vietnam in the 1950s. He had great athletic ability, and the skills and agility he had learnt through parcour earned him a reputation as an agile and elite soldier. In later life, he returned to France and passed on his skills to his son, David, who combined what he had learnt from his father with his own knowledge of martial arts and gymnastics, and in time, the sport of <i>parkour</i> was born.<br><br>
				Parkour involves a range of â€˜movesâ€™, although none are official. They involve vaulting, jumping and landing accurately on small and narrow features, catching ledges, traversing high wall and landing with a rolling impact to absorb impacts.
				Belle formed a group of traceurs called the Yamikasi, meaning â€˜strong man, strong spiritâ€™, that included his friend, Sebastian Foucan. In time, the two of them started to follow different paths. Belle concentrated on the art of getting from place to place in the most efficient way possible, while Foucan developed his own style which involved more self expression. This he termed freerunning.<br><br>

				From the late 1990s, the art and sport of parkour spread worldwide. Both Belle and Foucan gave interviews and appeared on television. In 2003, filmmaker Mike Christie made the film Jump London, and urban freerunning, or freeflow, began to dominate the London scene. But it was the arrival of YouTube in 2005 that really brought freerunning to a global audience. People around the world began to post their videos online, making freerunning a mainstream sport, and in 2007, the first major freerunning and parkour competition was held in Vienna.<br><br>

				Since parkour values freedom, there are few facilities dedicated to the practice. Traceurs use both rural and urban areas, typically parks, offices and abandoned buildings. Traceurs generally respect the environment they practice in, and since part of their philosophy is â€˜leave no traceâ€™, there have been few concerns over damage to property. However, law enforcement and fire and rescue teams argue that freerunners are risking their lives needlessly, especially when they practice at height. However, practitioners argue that injuries are rare, because they rely on their own hands and feet rather than things out of their immediate control, such as ice and wheels, as is the case with skiing and race-driving.<br>

				<h3>The Solar Farms Project</h3><br>

				The Barnley Village Committee is opposed to plans to build a 6,890 panel solar farm on a 15-acre site adjacent to the village recreation ground, currently used for agriculture. Under the proposed scheme, the area will be surrounded by an 8ft-high fence. The panels themselves will be about 7 feet high.<br>
				The committee has already lodged an appeal to the local authority against construction of the solar farm. The councillors are due to meet on 13th March to vote whether or not plans will go ahead. Local residents are invited to attend.  Our objections will be presented before the board, and a representative from the solar firm SunGen will put forward the case for the development.<br><br>

				Residents are encouraged to voice their objections to the development. These must address the aspects of the scheme that violate the current planning policy. However, you are welcome to make your objections personal, by stating how the plans will affect you as a user of the recreation ground.  Some of the most common objections are listed below:<br><br>

				1. The extensive views from the village and recreation ground across the open country will be blocked by the panels and high fencing. Furthermore, once the site has been built upon, it may be considered brownfield, thus an acceptable site for housing or industrial development. It does not, therefore, comply with the local policy which states that developments must not adversely effect on the appearance or character of the landscape.<br><br>

				2. The recreation ground has recently undergone major improvements including a perimeter running track, new playground equipment and seating. It is heavily used by families, sports teams and dog walkers, and is regularly used for village events.  Cricket and football teams regularly use the recreation ground and it is not uncommon for balls to enter the field. Cricketers are worried that they may become liable for damage to solar panels. If teams are forced to relocate, this would adversely affect the character of the village, and may jeopardise participation in the childrenâ€™s teams. This goes against the National Planning Policy Framework which requires developments to promote high quality public space and encourage the active and continual use of public areas.<br><br>

				3. There has been no assessment of the extent to which noise from inverters and cooling fans will affect local residents.<br><br>

				4. As the ground beneath the solar panels will be surfaced, there will be more additional run-off of rainwater. The recreation ground already has problems with drainage, and these may be exacerbated by this development. A formal flood risk assessment must be submitted.<br><br>

				5. The lighting and security systems have not been outlined, it is not clear how the area will be made safe for children<br><br>

				Email your objections to planning@barnelycouncil.gov.uk, and quote the reference BLY7458/00578 in the subject line.
